Academic project for the Internet Software Architectures course at Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad 

## About Project 
OnlyBuns is a web application that represents a social network for rabbit enthusiasts. It allows users to share and browse photos of their pets, as well as interact through likes and comments. Users can follow other profiles to personalize their feed and exchange messages via real-time chat implemented using WebSocket technology.

The application also supports group chats with admin management and message history. The backend is built in Spring Boot, the frontend is developed in Angular, and PostgreSQL is used as the database.

Additional features include caching, rate limiting, load balancing, image compression, periodic removal of inactive accounts, and email-based account verification during registration.
